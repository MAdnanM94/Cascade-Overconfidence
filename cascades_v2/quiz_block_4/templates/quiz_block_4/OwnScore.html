    <p>In this page, we will ask you about your <i>beliefs</i> about your score on the quiz you just took.</p>
    <p>For each score X from 0 to 10, we will ask you the following question <strong>"What do you think is the
    probability (0-100%) that your score is X?"</strong></p>
    <p>You will use the sliders to indicate your guess about the probabilities. <strong>Note that the probabilities
    must sum up to 100%.</strong></p>
