        <p>Welcome and thank you for taking part in this Economics Experiment. This experiment will last for around 2-2.5
            hours. If you read the instructions carefully, you can earn a considerable amount of money depending on your
            decisions and chance. Your earnings will be paid out to you via Cash at the end of the experiment.</p>

        <p><i>Before we begin, we ask that you turn off your cell phones for the duration of this experiment. We also ask
            that you do not communicate with anyone for the duration of this experiment and only use the software provided
            to you on your devices. Failure to comply with these rules may result in dismissal from this experiment and you
            will not be paid any earnings you may have otherwise received.</i></p>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <ol>
                    <li>This experiment has 5 blocks. Each block has 2 phases, and each phase has 6 sequences.
                        Your main task is to make guesses about the chance that the color assigned to your group is
                        Red in each sequence. </li>
                    <li>Before each block, you will be randomly assigned into groups of 6.</li>
                    <li>You will be assigned a score for a block. In Block A, the score will be randomly assigned
                        to you. In Blocks B-E, this will be based on your score on the quiz you will take at that
                        beginning of the block. </li>
                    <li>You will only take a quiz at the start of Blocks B, C, D, and E.</li>
                    <li>There are two phases for each block. In Phase 1, we will not reveal your assigned score.
                        In Phase 2, we will reveal your assigned score.</li>
                    <li>In Phase 1, we will ask about your beliefs on your own and a randomly selected group member's
                        quiz performance.</li>
                    <li>In Phase 2, we will show you your score and ask you about your belief on a randomly selected
                        group member's quiz performance.</li>
                    <li>A higher score means your private signal is more likely to match the color assigned to your
                        group for the sequence. A lower score means it's less likely to match the assigned color.</li>
                    <li>You will proceed with your main task of making guesses about the assigned color of the
                        sequence, 2 guesses per sequence, which means 12 guesses per phase with a total of 24
                        guesses per block</li>
                    <li>A color, <span style="color:red">Red</span> or <span style="color:blue">Blue</span>, will be
                        randomly assigned to your group with equal chance for each sequence.</li>
                    <li>You will make two guesses about the probability that the assigned color is
                        <span style="color:red">Red</span> for the sequence.</li>
                    <li>Before making your 1st guess, we will show you an indication of other's guesses for the
                        sequence. We will show you nothing if you are the first mover in the sequence, but you will
                        still know that Red is assigned with 50% chance.</li>
                    <li>Before making your 2nd guess, we will show you your private signal drawn from your jar.
                        You will still see the same indications from guess 1.</li>
                    <li>You will start as the 1st mover in the first sequence you face, then as 2nd mover in the
                        second sequence you face, â€¦, and lastly as the 6th mover in the sixth sequence you face.</li>
                    <li>You will proceed to the next block until you finish all 5 blocks.</li>

                <p>This experiment consists of a series of decision rounds spread out over <strong>5 blocks</strong>. At the
                    beginning of each block, you will be <strong>randomly</strong> assigned to a group with 6 participants
                    (including you). Neither you, nor your group members will know each other's identities. Your main
                    task is to make guesses about the chance that the color assigned to your group is Red.</p>

                <p>You will be given a signal to help you make your guesses. At the beginning of each block you will
                    be assigned a score from 0 to 10. The accuracy of the signal will depend on the score. The purpose
                    of a higher score is to have a more accurate signal to help you make your guess. How the scores
                    are assigned to each one in your group depends on the block. </p>

                <p><strong>In Block A - </strong>You will be randomly assigned a score from 0 to 10, each equally likely.</p>

                <p><strong>In Blocks B-E - </strong>Your group will first take part in a general knowledge trivia quiz.
                    Each quiz contains 10 questions. Your score in the quiz determines your assigned score for the
                    block. <strong> Everyone in your group will take the same quiz per block.</strong></p>

                    <li>You will then see a private signal that provides some hint as to your group's assigned color. You will then

                <p>We repeat this structure twice per block, once for each phase.</p>
                <p>A few points to note:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The color assigned to the group remains the same for each mover in a given sequence. However, the color assigned
                        in one sequence has no impact on the color assigned in another sequence. Knowing the color in one sequence
                        does not help you in making your guesses in another sequence</li>
                    <li>You will never face the same sequence twice i.e. you will make only one set of guesses in a given sequence</li>
                    <li>You will never follow the same person twice meaning you will follow a given person at most once in any
                        given sequence. Also, you will never follow yourself.</li>
                </ol>

    <!-- Payment Tab -->
    <div class="tab-pane" id="payment" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="payment-tab">
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>Your payment will depend on the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Your performance on one randomly chosen quiz (from Blocks B, C, D and E) (up to $10)</li>
            <li>Your guess on one of your scores for the selected quiz in 1) (up to $2))</li>
            <li>Your guess on one of the scores of your group member's performance for the selected quiz in 1) (up to $2)</li>
            <li>Your two guesses in one randomly chosen sequence in Blocks A to E. (up to $24)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>After each block, you will be shown the <em>possible</em> payment you can receive provided the block or quiz is
            chosen for payment.</p>
        <p>For 1) we will pool your quiz score with the scores of 44 people who have previously taken the same quiz.
            Your earnings for your performance on the quiz will be $10 * r where r is your percentile on the quiz.</p>
        <p>For 4), the computer will first randomly choose a sequence for the block. Each of the 12 sequences
            is equally likely to be chosen. The computer will then draw a random number Y1 from 0 to 100. <strong>If Y1
            is less than or equal to your reported Guess 1</strong>, then you will be paid <strong>$12 if the assigned
            color is Red. If Y1 is greater than your guess,</strong> then you will be paid based on a lottery in
            which <strong>you can earn $12 with Y1% chance.</strong></p>
        <p>The computer will draw another random number Y2 from 0 to 100 for Guess 2. Then, the same payment scheme
            is implemented for your reported Guess 2 in the chosen sequence. This can earn $12.</p>
        <p>For your guesses about your own and random memberâ€™s quiz performance (parts (2) and (3)), the computer
            will randomly choose a score S from the selected quiz in part (1). The computer will then generate a
            number Y from 0 to 100. If Y is less than your guess, then you will be paid $2 if the score is S.
            If it less than Y, then you will be paid based on a lottery than can earn $2 with Y% chance.
            Each guess on the two selected scores can earn $2.</p>
        <p>At the end of the experiment, the computer will randomly draw a block from A to E and a quiz from blocks B to
            E. You will be paid for the chosen block and quiz as stated above. In addition to this, you will also
            be paid a $5 show-up fee.</p>
        <p><strong>Note: The payment scheme is designed in a way to ensure that the best way to maximize your earnings is to
            report your true guess for the probability. For example, for guesses regarding the color Red, you maximize your
            earnings by reporting your true beliefs regarding the probability of the color being Red.</strong></p>
